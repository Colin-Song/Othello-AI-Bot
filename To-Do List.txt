Positional value (value board)
Mobility (number of our valid moves - number of opp valid moves)
Stability (number of our stable discs - number of opp stable discs)
Frontier discs (number of opp frontiers - number of our frontiers
Greed Penalty?


Function = w1*PositionalValue + w2*Mobility + w3*Stability + w4*Frontier


Get valid moves list
Iterate through valid moves list
	Apply function on move
		(For move get positional value of that move,
		Get mobility of board after the move,
		Get stability of board after the move,
		Get frontier discs after the move)
	Store this value/move

From best move to worst move, run MTCS and then decide on move based off of MTCS
